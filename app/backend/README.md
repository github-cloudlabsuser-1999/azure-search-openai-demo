# Backend Application

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the backend application, including its requirements, setup, and usage.
## Requirements
The backend application has several dependencies that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here are some of the key dependencies:

- `aiofiles==23.2.1`: For asynchronous file handling.
- `aiohttp==3.9.5`: For making HTTP requests in a non-blocking way.
- `azure-ai-documentintelligence==1.0.0b3`: For AI document intelligence services from Azure.
- `azure-cognitiveservices-speech==1.37.0`: For speech services from Azure Cognitive Services.
- `flask==3.0.3`: A lightweight web application framework.
- `numpy==1.26.4`: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- `openai[datalib]==1.31.0`: For interacting with the OpenAI API.

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the complete list of dependencies.
